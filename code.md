## Free & Open Source Software in Government
### Proposed Launch
- May 15, 16, or 17
### Proposed Topics
- Define the free & open source software movement.
- What is the goal of Code.mil? How does it tie into the larger view of open source software in government?
- Why should government employees be concerned about moving their code to the public domain? Who cares?
- Isn't it a lot of "busy work" to open source software? How will this help govies do their work better?
- What about security? Doesn't releasing our source code to the world open up critical US infrastructure to malicious attacks?
